this is a generic key which is included by default when you install office 2016 ProPLus VL version for the first time so this key will only activate your office 2016 version for 6 months and after that, you will have to activate it again.

there is no key available to activate permanently office 2016 version at this moment so if you want to activate it for 6 months until new key appears, you can do this :
cmd (in administrator mode) then you copy all these lines at the same time then paste them in command prompt : 

if exist "%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Office\Office16\ospp.vbs" cd /d "%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Office\Office16"
if exist "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Office\Office16\ospp.vbs" cd /d "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Office\Office16"
cscript ospp.vbs /sethst:kms.lotro.cc
cscript ospp.vbs /act
